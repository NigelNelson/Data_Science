    "# Lab 03: Exploratory Data Analysis with Statistical Testing\n",
    "### Author: Nigel Nelson\n",
    "### Introduction:\n",
    "- This lab builds off of *Lab 1: Data Cleaning* by using the resulting cleaned data set as the primary data set for this lab. The data set, *CleanedSacramentorealestatetransactions*, has 919 entries and 14 variables describing real estate transactions in California. This includes the **street** address, the **city**, the **zip**, the **state**, the numbers of **beds**, the number of **baths**, the square footage of residential space(**sq_ft**), the **type** of real estate, the **sale date**, the sale **price**, the **latitude**, the **longitude**, whether it is an **empty_lot**, and the **street_type**. In this lab, Statistical tests are used to analyze the relationships between 3 different combinations of the data set's variables: continuous vs. continuous, continuous vs categorical, and categorical vs. categorical. Through these statistical tests, it is determined which variable pairs have meaningful relationships. This is done so that comparisons can be made with *Lab 2 EDA -- Visualization* and the variable pairs that were determined to be meaningful in that past lab using analysis of the created visualizations. By comparing the results as well as the analysis methods used between these two labs, conclusions can be made about the efficacy of methods used, and in which context the results from the two are meaningful.\n",

    "above meet those criteria? Are there any particular assumptions that the t-test makes \n",
    "that may not hold here?\n",
    "  - A two-sample t-test in used for two samples when there is one measurement variable and one nominal variable, and the nominal value only has two values, as such, this video game example fits these requirements perfectly. This test assumes that the observations in each group are normally distributed and that the data is homoscedastic. For this data set it is possible that neither of these are true. Perhaps the collection method for this survey was not random, and instead the surveys were handed out at a video game club, and at an athletic event. This could result in these assumptions not holding as many athletic teams require students hold a minimum GPA to participate, resulting in a non-normal distribution of GPA, and also result in contrasting standard deviations between the two groups.\n",
    "2. Null hypothesis:\n",
    "  - The group that answered they don't play video games will have the same mean GPA as the group who answered that they don’t play video games.\n",
    "3. Alternative hypothesis:\n",
    "  - The group that answered they don't play video games will have a different mean GPA than the group who answered that they don’t play video games.\n",

    "#### Interpreting p-value:\n",
    "- Using a significance threshold of 0.01, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. This means that the differences in GPAs of the two groups are not statistically significant. This means that for the groups surveyed the hypothesis that those who play video games will have a lower GPA is false. However, this data represents a relatively small sample size and thus more data collection and statistical tests must be conducted in order to definitively reject or accept the null hypothesis of whether video game playing affects GPA.\n",

However, the graphical analysis method did not determine that latitude, longitude, empty_lot, and street_type were predictive of price while the statistical testing method did. These differences are likely due to the binary nature of the statistical test's hypotheses in comparison to the more nuanced evaluation used in lab 2. Latitude and Longitude were determined to be significant predictors of price by using linear regression, in which the null hypothesis states that the line of best fit between the two variables is 0. So, no matter how loose the line of best fit is, as long as it's slope is not 0 with some degree of certainty the null hypothesis can be rejected. So while latitude and longitude do not have a visually clear linear relationship with price, the underlying line of best fit is not 0 to a reasonable degree of certainty. As for empty_lot and street_type, the statistical test used in the Kruskal-Wallis test, whose null hypothesis in this case is that the average rank of prices for each of the groups contained in the categorical variable is the same. So in order to reject this hypothesis, the average price rank of each variable's contained groups just had to be marginally different, even if it isn't obvious through visual analysis."

    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "- This lab acted as an exercise in using statistical tests in order to determine meaningful relationships between a data set's variables. In order to account for the all of the different combinations of variable types that could have relationships, the following statistical tests were used to determine inter-variable relationships: Linear Regression, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Chi-squared test. From these tests, it was determined that for **price**, the variables square feet, latitude, longitude, zip, city, beds, baths, type, empty_lot, street_type were all predictive to some degree. As for **type**, it was determined that price, sq_ft, city, zip, beds, baths, and street_type were all predictive to some degree. Compared to Lab 2's results, these conclusions were mostly consistent. However, the statistical test concluded that several variables were predictive that were not considered predictive in the results of Lab 2. The likely reason for this difference is that the statistical tests are binary in nature, either the variables have no correlation at all, or this is some correlation, even if it is a very minute amount. In contrast, Lab 2's analysis method was much more nuanced as visual inspection and ones own opinion was used to determine if variables were predictive of each other."
